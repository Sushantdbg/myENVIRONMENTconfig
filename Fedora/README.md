# This is all about from for the first boot into fedora to the state I m satisfied this is what I wan't this to be

## As Im kind of into "distro-hopping" and have previous experince with the likes of Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, Garuda, Ubuntu and Now Fedora being the newest editon to the list so her I will try to add some documentation to all.



### Her I will probably have to make an index

## Updating the system and it's packages

### To check Update

```bash
dnf check-update
```

### To start the upgrade after you went through the list of updates available

```bash
sudo dnf upgrade

```

### After the above is complete it's reccomended to reboot even though not neccessary; You can do the same by manual reboot or just run the below

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
```
